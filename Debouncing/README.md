This part was coded onto the G2553 and the FR2331. In order to get the button to not bounce, a few things need to happen. First you set the gpio pins P1.3 and P1.0 to input and output respectively. Then you eneable and set the pull down register for the button and then set the input to the button. Then the clock is set to off mode, sets the divider to 8, and sets the clock to A clock. Then the interupts are enabled for the button and the timer and sets the count register to 200. Then the button is set to the rising edge and then clears the interupt flags. Then a command is set so that when the processor isn't working, it is in low power mode. Then the interupt methods are set up. For the button interupt, the clock is set to up mode, so that it counts to CCR0. Then it sets the button interupt to the falling edge. For the timer interupt, it turns the clock off, toggles the LED, clears the clock, sets the interupt back to rising edge, and clears the flag.
