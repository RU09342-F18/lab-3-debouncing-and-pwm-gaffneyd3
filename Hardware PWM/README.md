This part of the lab is exaclty the same as the softare part, but insteads utilizes the hardware so that it perfoms the interupts for the timer without having to writing it ourselves. These changes are shown in the 21st line that enables the set reset interupt part of the clock timer. Then that basically performs the timer interupt so that part isn't needed. The rest is the same.
