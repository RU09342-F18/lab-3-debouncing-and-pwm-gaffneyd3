In this program the lab was performed on the G2553 and FR2331 board. In this lab the goal is to produce a PWM signal using software. The way that this goal is achieved is by doing the following. First the gpio pins are set to input and output for the button and the led. and then sets the 2nd led to the output which will be the PWM. Then the pull down register is enabled. Then the clock is set up by setting the clock to count to 255, and then sets another register to half of that. Also the clock is set to smclk, enables the itnerupts for the button and the clock and then sets the divider to 4. Then for the button interupt it checks to see if the button is pushed, and if it is, it turns on the indicator led to know that the duty cycle is being changed. Then it changes the button to falling edge and changes the duty cycle by adding 10%. Then it clears the flag for the button. For the timer interupt, it checks the different cases that the interupt vector will have. If its 2, its the compare register for the duty cycle and turns off the led, if its 4, it skips, and if its 10, it overflows and turns on the led.
